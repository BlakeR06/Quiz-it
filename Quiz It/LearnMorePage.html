        <div class="small_White_Text learn_More_Page_Text">Welcome to Quiz-it! I'm currently a computer science major at Ball State University, and I'm excited to share this project with you. Quiz-it is designed to be a free online study tool to help enhance your education. Right now, you can create and use flashcards, but I'm actively working on adding more features like multiple-choice questions and matching games to make studying even more engaging and effective. Stay tuned for more updates and improvements!</div>
